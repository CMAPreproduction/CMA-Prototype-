      <p>Whistleblowers are employees, or former employees, that report illegal activities carried out by the business or organisation they're employed by.</p>

      <p>If the illegal activity relates to the sale of products, the supply of services or about competition affecting markets in the UK, it's important you report it to the CMA.</p>
        
      <p>You can email: <a href="mailto:whistleblower@cma.gov.uk">whistleblower@cma.gov.uk </a></p>
        
      <p>Find out more about what it means to be a whistleblower, including your rights and how the CMA will protect your identity on our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/whistleblowers-at-the-cma">whistleblowing guidance page</a>.</p>
