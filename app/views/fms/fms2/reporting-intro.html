      <p class="govuk-body">Rather than present a user with a menu of choices of what they are reporting as a series of check-boxes, a series of questions would interactively determine the appropriate forms to show.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The questions ask:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href="./reporting-type">Organisation Type</a> - Funeral Director, Crematorium Operator, or both</li>
        <li><a href="./reporting-branches">Number of Branches</a> - shown if Funeral Director chosen - more than 5, or more than 10</li>
        <li><a href="./reporting-period">Reporting Period</a> - shown if Crematorium Operator chosen - April and/or October</li>
        <li><a href="./reporting-compliance">Compliance Statement</a> - asks if they will be filing a compliance statement</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">For the purposes of this prototype, these questions are NOT responsive to each other, but in a real application, they would be (so for example the branches question is only asked if you prevously chose "Funeral Director").</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">After answering the above questions, the user would be led through the appropriate forms to satisfy their answers (parts A, B, C and D of the submission, and an appropriate compliance statement).</p>
