        Make a Whistleblower Report
      </h1>

      <p>Use this service to tell the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/competition-and-markets-authority/about">Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)</a> about illegal activities carried out by the business or organisation you're employed by.</p>

      <p>If the illegal activity relates to the sale of products, the supply of services or about competition affecting markets in the UK, it's important you report it to the CMA.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/whistleblowers-at-the-cma">Find out more about whistleblowing</a>, and what it means to be a whistle-blower, including your rights and how the CMA will protect your identity.</p>

      <p>The information you provide will help the CMA to prioritise its action against possible breaches of competition or consumer law.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Information you will need to provide</h2>
